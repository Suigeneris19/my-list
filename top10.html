    <h1>MY Top 5 Anime</h1>
    <p style="font-size:160%">In the recent times we have seen some amazing anime series coming up and fantasy geners shonen anime is on rise.So here are top 5 fantasy anime according</p>
    <h4>NOTE:this ranking is based on my personal preference</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><h2>5.HunterXHunter</h2></li>
      <img class="fit-picture" src="https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hunter-x-hunter-227815.png" alt="HxH" width="800" height="500">
      <p style="font-size:150%">Hunter x Hunter is a shounen anime adapted from the original long-running manga series, which started in 1998 and still hasn’t ended.
        The manga success led to the first anime adaptation in 1998 and another one in 2011. Even though it would make sense to watch the older one first, the second version is practically a reboot with better animation.
      The animation of the Hunter x Hunter 2011 anime series is smooth, stunning and only gets better as the series evolves. It also uses more comedic tropes than the older version.</p>

       <li><h2>2.Naruto</h2></li>

        <p style="font-size:150%">Naruto is a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja still living in Konohagakure. Shunned because of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place in the village,
           while his burning desire to become the Hokage of Konohagakure leads him not only to some great new friends, but also some deadly foes.</p>

           <p style="font-size:150%">Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate
             ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure.</p>
